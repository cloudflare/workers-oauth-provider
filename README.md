# OAuth 2.1 Provider Framework for Cloudflare Workers

This is a TypeScript library that implements the provider side of the OAuth 2.1 protocol with PKCE support. The library is intended to be used on Cloudflare Workers.

## Benefits of this library

* The library acts as a wrapper around your Worker code, which adds authorization for your API endpoints.
* All token management is handled automatically.
* Your API handler is written like a regular fetch handler, but receives the already-authenticated user details as a parameter. No need to perform any checks of your own.
* The library is agnostic to how you manage and authenticate users.
* The library is agnostic to how you build your UI. Your authorization flow can be implemented using whatever UI framework you use for everything else.
* The library's storage does not store any secrets, only hashes of them.

## Usage

A Worker that uses the library might look like this:

```ts
import { OAuthProvider, OAuthHelpers } from "my-oauth";

// We export the OAuthProvider instance as the entrypoint to our Worker. This means it
// implements the `fetch()` handler, receiving all HTTP requests.
export default new OAuthProvider({
  // Configure my API route. Any requests whose URL starts with this will be considered to be
  // API requests. The OAuth provider will check the access token on these requests, and then,
  // if the token is valid, send the request to the API handler.
  apiRoute: "https://example.com/api/",

  // When the OAuth system receives an API request with a valid access token, it passes the request
  // to this handler object's fetch method.
  apiHandler: apiHandler,

  // Any requests which aren't API request will be passed to the default handler instead.
  defaultHandler: defaultHandler,

  // This specifies the URL of the OAuth authorization flow UI. This UI is NOT implemented by
  // the OAuthProvider. It is up to the application to implement a UI here. The only reason why
  // this URL is given to the OAuthProvider is so that it can implement the RFC-8414 metadata
  // discovery endpoint, i.e. `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
  authorizeEndpoint: "https://example.com/authorize",

  // This specifies the OAuth 2 token exchange endpoint. The OAuthProvider will implement this
  // endpoint (by directly responding to requests with a matching URL).
  tokenEndpoint: "https://example.com/oauth/token",

  // This specifies the RFC-7591 dynamic client registration endpoint. This setting is optional,
  // but if provided, the OAuthProvider will implement this endpoint to allow dynamic client
  // registration.
  clientRegistrationEndpoint: "https://example.com/oauth/register"
});

// The default handler object - the OAuthProvider will pass through HTTP requests to this object's fetch method 
// if they aren't API requests or do not have a valid access token
const defaultHandler = {
  // This fetch method works just like a standard Cloudflare Workers fetch handler
  //
  // The `request`, `env`, and `ctx` parameters are the same as for a normal Cloudflare Workers fetch
  // handler, and are exactly the objects that the `OAuthProvider` itself received from the Workers
  // runtime.
  //
  // The `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` provides an API by which the application can call back to the
  // OAuthProvider.
  async fetch(request: Request, env, ctx) {
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname == "/authorize") {
      // This is a request for our OAuth authorization flow UI. It is up to the application to
      // implement this. However, the OAuthProvider library provides some helpers to assist.

      // `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.parseAuthRequest()` parses the OAuth authorization request to extract the parameters
      // required by the OAuth 2 standard, namely response_type, client_id, redirect_uri, scope, and
      // state. It returns an object containing all these (using idiomatic camelCase naming).
      let oauthReqInfo = env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.parseAuthRequest(request);

      // `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.lookupClient()` looks up metadata about the client, as definetd by RFC-7591. This
      // includes things like redirect_uris, client_name, logo_uri, etc.
      let clientInfo = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.lookupClient(oauthReqInfo.clientId);

      // At this point, the application should use `oauthReqInfo` and `clientInfo` to render an
      // authorization consent UI to the user. The details of this are up to the app so are not
      // shown here.

      // After the user has granted consent, the application calls `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization()` to
      // grant the authorization.
      let {redirectTo} = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization({
        // The application passes back the original OAuth request info that was returned by
        // `parseAuthRequest()` earlier.
        request: oauthReqInfo,

        // The application must specify the user's ID, which is some sort of string. This is needed
        // so that the application can later query the OAuthProvider to enumerate all grants
        // belonging to a particular user, e.g. to implement an audit and revocation UI.
        userId: "1234",

        // The application can specify some arbitary metadata which describes this grant. The
        // metadata can contain any JSON-serializable content. This metadata is not used by the
        // OAuthProvider, but the application can read back the metadata attached to specific
        // grants when enumerating them later, again e.g. to implement an udit and revocation UI.
        metadata: {label: "foo"},

        // The application specifies the list of OAuth scope identifiers that were granted. This
        // may or may not be the same as was requested in `oauthReqInfo.scope`.
        scope: ["document.read", "document.write"],

        // `props` is an arbitrary JSON-serializable object which will be passed back to the API
        // handler for every request authorized by this grant.
        props: {
          userId: 1234,
          username: "Bob"
        }
      });

      // `completeAuthorization()` will have returned the URL to which the user should be redirected
      // in order to complete the authorization flow. This is the requesting client's OAuth
      // redirect_uri with the appropriate query parameters added to complete the flow and obtain
      // tokens.
      return Response.redirect(redirectTo, 302);
    }

    // ... the application can implement other non-API HTTP endpoints here ...

    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
};

// The API handler object - the OAuthProivder will pass authorized API requests to this object's fetch method
// (because we provided it as the `apiHandler` setting, above). This is ONLY called for API requests 
// that had a valid access token.
const apiHandler = {
  // This fetch method works just like a standard Cloudflare Workers fetch handler
  //
  // The `request`, `env`, and `ctx` parameters are the same as for a normal Cloudflare Workers fetch
  // handler.
  //
  // The `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` is available just like in the default handler.
  //
  // The `ctx.props` property contains the `props` value that was passed to
  // `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization()` during the authorization flow that authorized this client.
  fetch(request: Request, env, ctx) {
    // The application can implement its API endpoints like normal. This app implements a single
    // endpoint, `/api/whoami`, which returns the user's authenticated identity.

    let url = new URL(request.url);
    if (url.pathname == "/api/whoami") {
      // Since the username is embedded in `ctx.props`, which came from the access token that the
      // OAuthProivder already verified, we don't need to do any other authentication steps.
      return new Response(`You are authenticated as: ${ctx.props.username}`);
    }

    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
};
```

This implementation requires that your worker is configured with a Workers KV namespace binding called `OAUTH_KV`, which is used to store token information. See the file `storage-schema.md` for details on the schema of this namespace.

The `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` object available to the fetch handlers provides some methods to query the storage, including:

* Create, list, modify, and delete client_id registrations (in addition to `lookupClient()`, already shown in the example code).
* List all active authorization grants for a particular user.
* Revoke (delete) an authorization grant.

See the `OAuthHelpers` interface definition for full API details.

## Implementation Notes

### Single-use refresh tokens?

OAuth 2.1 requires that refresh tokens are either "cryptographically bound" to the client, or are single-use. This library currently does not implement any cryptographic binding, thus seemingly requiring single-use tokens. Under this requirement, every token refresh request invalidates the old refresh token and issues a new one.

This requirement is seemingly fundamentally flawed as it assumes that every refresh request will complete with no errors. In the real world, a transient network error, machine failure, or software fault could mean that the client fails to store the new refresh token after a refresh request. In this case, the client would be permanently unable to make any further requests, as the only token it has is no longer valid.

This library implements a compromise: At any particular time, a grant may have two valid refresh tokens. When the client uses one of them, the other one is invalidated, and a new one is generated and returned. Thus, if the client correctly uses the new refresh token each time, then older refresh tokens are continuously invalidated. But if a transient failure prevents the client from updating its token, it can always retry the request with the token it used previously.
