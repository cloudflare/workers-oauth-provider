### Patch Changes

- [#98](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/98) [`0982a1c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/0982a1c61e2aab25cddd929738d1f3d94be08e7a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Enhance redirect URI scheme validation for security

  Added a robust helper to validate redirect URI schemes, preventing dangerous pseudo-schemes (e.g., javascript:, data:, vbscript:) with normalization and case-insensitive checks. Expanded test coverage to include bypass attempts using mixed case, whitespace, control characters, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive protection against XSS and related attacks.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- [#87](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/87) [`1804446`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/1804446ba6d17fa7e6395e47a4fecef374d7e1bd) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - explicitly block javascript: (and other suspicious protocols) in redirect uris

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/80, we blocked redirects that didn't start with http:// or https:// to prevent xss attacks with javascript: URIs. However this blocked redirects to custom apps like cursor:// et al. This patch now explicitly blocks javascript: (and other suspicious protocols) in redirect uris.

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/81) [`d18b865`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/d18b865bb21a669993424da89ebca47d391644ba) Thanks [@deathbyknowledge](https://github.com/deathbyknowledge)! - Add resolveExternalToken to support external token auth flows

  Adds resolveExternalToken to support auth for external tokens. The callback only runs IF internal auth check fails. E.g. a canonical OAuth server is used by multiple services, allowing server-server communication with the same token.

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/74) [`9d4b595`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/9d4b595f63d2aebd5700e4021967b98173cd3755) Thanks [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr)! - Add configurable refresh token expiration
  - New `refreshTokenTTL` option to set global expiration for refresh tokens
  - Support for per-token TTL override via `tokenExchangeCallback`
  - Expired tokens return `invalid_grant` error, forcing reauthentication
  - Backward compatible: tokens without TTL never expire
